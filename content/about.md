Hey, I’m Caiyi! 👋 A tech enthusiast with a passion for all things programming, cybersecurity, automation, and home labs. My journey through the digital landscape has been fueled by curiosity and a desire to push the boundaries of what’s possible with tech.

## My Home Lab Adventures 🛠️

My home lab is where the magic happens. It’s my personal playground where I experiment, automate, and secure everything I can get my hands on. Here’s a glimpse into what I’m up to:

### 🖥️ Virtualization & Automation

I love tinkering with Proxmox and Docker to create a fully virtualized environment. Automating VM provisioning with Packer, Terraform, and Ansible? Absolutely. It’s like building a tiny digital city where I control everything!

### 🔒 Security & Privacy

Securing my setup is a top priority. VLAN configurations, custom firewall rules, and systematic backups with Restic keep everything locked down tight. I’m always on the lookout for new ways to make my lab even more secure.

### 🔧 Scripting & Automation

Why do things manually when you can automate? From system updates to real-time failure monitoring, I script it all. I use tools like ntfy to keep me informed of any hiccups, ensuring my lab runs smoothly 24/7.

## Certifications 🎓

While my home lab is my true love, I’ve also picked up some certifications along the way:

- **OSCP & OSWP**: Mastery in offensive security and wireless network security.
- **Fortinet NSE 6 - FortiSOAR**: Expert in managing FortiSOAR in SOC environments.

## Let’s Geek Out Together 🤓

If you’re into home labs, cybersecurity, or just love geeking out over the latest tech, you’ve come to the right place. Let’s connect and share ideas on how to make our digital worlds more secure, automated, and just plain cool!
